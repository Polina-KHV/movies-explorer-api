# **Movies-Explorer-API**
## Diploma project for [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/)

The backend part for project [Movies Explorer](https://github.com/Polina-KHV/movies-explorer-frontend).  

The api provides the following options:  
- registration and authorization  
- edition of profile information  
- creating and removing movies  

This code is developed on Express framework connected to Mongo database. To protect user personal information i use cookie files. Also to enlarge the security level i use cors, helmet and rate limit modules.
